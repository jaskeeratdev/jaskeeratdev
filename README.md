Hello, I’m Jaskeerat Singh

Creative Front-End Developer and Web Designer

I build responsive, user-friendly websites and digital solutions that solve real problems. I specialize in full-stack development using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I am currently completing my Digital Media and IT diploma at NAIT, where I continue to develop my technical skills and practical experience.

About Me

Web Designer and Developer focused on building digital solutions that matter.

My interest in web development started in high school when I created my first interactive webpage in a computer science class. Seeing how code could turn into something functional and visual motivated me to continue learning and improving. Since then, I have worked on academic and personal projects that have strengthened my understanding of front-end and back-end development.

Over the past year, I have gained hands-on experience with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I enjoy solving problems, writing clean code, and designing websites that are both visually clear and easy to use. I believe strong websites balance functionality, structure, and user experience.

My goal is to grow as a freelance web developer and IT consultant, working with small businesses and entrepreneurs to create responsive websites and practical digital solutions that support their goals.
