## 💻 About Me

**Web Designer & Developer | Building Digital Solutions That Matter**

> "Great websites combine clean code, intuitive design, and purposeful functionality."

I'm a passionate web designer and developer currently completing my Digital Media & IT diploma at NAIT. My journey into web development began in a high school computer science class when I built my first interactive webpage. Watching code transform into a functional website sparked an interest that has shaped my career path ever since.

Over the past year, I’ve strengthened my skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL through hands-on academic and personal projects. I enjoy transforming complex problems into clean, user-friendly solutions that balance performance and design.

My goal is to establish myself as a trusted freelance web developer and IT consultant, helping small businesses and entrepreneurs create responsive websites and customized digital solutions.
